The complexity of people can\u2019t be measured, averaged, and compared like time to first byte can, unless we want to hide our unconscious biases in the numbers, too.As the Automattic engineering organization started growing, we went back to first principles, instead of randomly copy/pasting bits and pieces from past experiences and from across the industry. The process we designed reduced bias via text interviews, extra flexibility for applicants, and training for interviewers. A core principle is to test good mutual fit via tasks closer to \u201cproduction\u201d \u2013 closer to the day-to-day work of a developer at Automattic. During different stages, this principle shows in different ways. At the interview, you are free to use Google or Stack Overflow. The take-home test is an existing codebase, instead of an abstract algorithmic task. Our final \u201ctrial\u201d project gives you enough space to show your real programming, architecture, and writing skills.
